# Helsinki-profile / OmaHelsinki / Citizen-profile UI

UI for citizen-profile.

## Environments

Dev: https://profiili.dev.hel.ninja/

Test: https://profiili.test.hel.ninja/

Production: https://profiili.hel.fi

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html#vite

Scripts generates first environment variables to `public/env-config.js` with `scripts/update-runtime-env.ts`, which contains the
actual used variables when running the app. App is not using default `process.env` way to refer of variables but
`window._env_` object.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://vitest.dev/guide/) for more information.

Scripts generates first environment variables to `public/env-config.js` with `scripts/update-runtime-env.ts`, which contains the
actual used variables when running the app. App is not using default `process.env` way to refer of variables but
`window._env_` object.

### `yarn test:e2e`

Runs end-to-end tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).

It is recommended to run these tests to ensure the overall functionality and user experience of the application.

The tests use the following environment variables to configure the URLs of different components or services that they interact with:

    LINKED_EVENTS_URL
    PROFILE_URL
    PROFILE_API_URL
    EXAMPLE_APP_URL
    TUNNISTAMO_URL
    TUNNISTUS_URL

Please ensure these environment variables are correctly set in your environment before running the tests.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [build](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html#build) for more information.

Note that running built application locally you need to generate also `public/env-config.js` file. It can be done with
`yarn update-runtime-env`. By default it's generated for development environment if no `NODE_ENV` is set.

### `yarn codegen`

Generate static types for GraphQL queries by using the schema from the backend server.

### `yarn update-translations`

Fetches translation data from our Google Spreadsheet and updates translation files. See `.env` for configuration.

You still need to update tests and add the translation files to the git repository manually.

### `yarn update-runtime-env`

Generates variable object used when app is running. Generated object is stored at `public/env-config.js` and available
as `window._env_` object.

Generation uses values from either
[environment variables or files](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html).

At the production deployment same generation is done with [`env.sh`](scripts/env.sh).

### `yarn update-country-codes`

Fetches country calling codes and generates src/i18n/countryCallingCodes.json file. See scripts/update-country-calling-codes.ts for more information.

## Setting up local development environment with Docker

### Set tunnistamo hostname

Add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on mac and linux):

    127.0.0.1 tunnistamo-backend

### Create a new OAuth app on GitHub

Go to https://github.com/settings/developers/ and add a new app with the following settings:

- Application name: can be anything, e.g. local tunnistamo
- Homepage URL: http://tunnistamo-backend:8000
- Authorization callback URL: http://tunnistamo-backend:8000/accounts/github/login/callback/

Save. You'll need the created **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for configuring tunnistamo in the next step.

### Install local tunnistamo

Clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/tunnistamo/.

Follow the instructions for setting up tunnistamo locally. Before running `docker-compose up` set the following settings in tunnistamo roots `docker-compose.env.yaml`:

- SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY: **Client ID** from the GitHub OAuth app
- SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET: **Client Secret** from the GitHub OAuth app

Run `docker-compose up`

After container is up and running, few things need to be set up at http://localhost:8000/admin

**OIDC client**

The ID of this client must be the same as set in the REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID environment variable.

Requires the following things:

- Response types - 'code' OR 'id_token token'
- Redirect URIs (app-url is where the UI is running, e.g. http://localhost:3000 for development) - {app-url}/callback, {app-url}/silent_renew
- Client ID - the name as noted above
- Login methods - which providers can be used to authenticate, should have at least GitHub enabled for development.

**API Scopes**

The scopes this app uses are set with the REACT_APP_OIDC_SCOPE environment variable.

### Install local open-city-profile

Clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/open-city-profile/.

1. Create a `docker-compose.env.yaml` file in the project folder:

   - Use `docker-compose.env.yaml.example` as a base, it does not need any changes
     for getting the project running.
   - Change `DEBUG` and the rest of the Django settings if needed.
     - `TOKEN_AUTH_*`, settings for [tunnistamo](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/tunnistamo) authentication service
   - Set entrypoint/startup variables according to taste.

     - `CREATE_SUPERUSER`, creates a superuser with credentials `admin`:`admin` (admin@example.com)
     - `APPLY_MIGRATIONS`, applies migrations on startup
     - `BOOTSTRAP_DIVISIONS`, bootstrap data import for divisions

2. Run `docker-compose up`

### open-city-profile-ui

If running on Linux or MacOS, easiest way is to just run the app without docker. Any semi-new version of node should probably work, the docker-image is set to use node 14.

`docker-compose up` starts the container.

OR

Run `yarn` to install dependencies, start app with `yarn start`.

The graphql-backend for development is located at https://profiili-api.test.kuva.hel.ninja/graphql/, it has graphiql installed so you can browse it in your browser!
