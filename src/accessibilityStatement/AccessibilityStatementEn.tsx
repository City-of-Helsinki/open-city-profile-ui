      <FocusableH1>Accessibility statement for Helsinki profile</FocusableH1>
      <p>
        This accessibility statement applies to the Helsinki profile webservice
        (https://profiili.hel.fi) run by the City of Helsinki. This statement
        explains the webservice’s accessibility and how to submit
        accessibility-related feedback.

      <h2>How accessible is this webservice?</h2>
      <p>
        Finland’s Act on the Provision of Digital Services states that public
        websites must be accessible. In other words, everyone should have an
        equal opportunity to use websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        This webservice is fully compliant with all of the statutorily mandated
        accessibility requirements (WCAG criteria 2.1, A and AA standards).

      <h3>Accessibility assessment</h3>
      <p>
        The accessibility assessment follows the City of Helsinki’s operational
        guidelines and methods that aim to secure the service’s accessibility
        throughout every work stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accessibility of the webservice has been assessed by both a
        self-assessment and a third-party expert audit. The assessment included
        programmatic accessibility testing and a manual examination of the
        webservice and its content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shortcomings identified in the accessibility audit have been
        corrected by 21.05.2024.
      </p>
      <p>The external expert audit was carried out by Unicus Oy.</p>
